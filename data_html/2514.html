<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>In a galaxy far, far away, there is the planet NlÃ´guÃ©rrÃ , predominantly inhabited by dinosaurs. There are three moons orbiting NlÃ´guÃ©rrÃ . The orbit of each moon has the form of a circumference whose center is NlÃ´guÃ©rrÃ , as indicated by the figure in the left:</p>

<p>
                    When all three moons align between the planet and the sun, as indicated by the figure in the right, a horrible catastrophe happens! The last time it occurred, exactly <strong>M</strong> years ago, a big drought doomed the entire planet, reducing the number of dinosaurs by half. The first moon takes <strong>L<sub>1</sub></strong> years to complete an orbit around the planet; the second moon takes <strong>L<sub>2</sub></strong> years to complete an orbit around the planet; and the third moon takes <strong>L<sub>3</sub></strong> years to do so. Determine how many years will pass until the next alignment.
                </p>
<p>Consider that both the planet and the sun are stacionary.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>
                    The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains the integer <strong>M</strong> (1 â¤ <strong>M</strong> â¤ 10<sup>9</sup>), indicating that the last alignment occurred <strong>M</strong> years ago. The second line contains three integers <strong>L<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>L<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>L<sub>3</sub></strong> (1 â¤ <strong>L<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>L<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>L<sub>3</sub></strong> â¤ 10<sup>3</sup>), the time it takes, in years, for each moon to complete its orbit around the planet. It is guaranteed that no alignment occurred in the last <strong>M</strong>-1 years, and no alignment occurs this year.
                </p>
<p>The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case, print a line containing a number <strong>X</strong> indicating that the next alignment between the planet and the sun will occur in <strong>X</strong> years from this day.</p>
