<p>Ribeiro, after the defeat of the Brazilian team by 7 x 1 in 2014, has serious problems with these two digits. Now every number he sees, he wants to know how many digits <strong>1</strong> and how many digits <strong>7</strong> appear in all the numbers <strong>1</strong> through <strong>N</strong>, inclusive.</p>
<p>He knows that you are a great programmer and will help you. To "facilitate" his life, Ribeiro said he wants to know only the sum of the number of digits <strong>1</strong> with the number of digits <strong>7</strong> that appear between all the numbers from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>N</strong>, inclusive.</p>
<p>For example, think of the number 11: The numbers 1 through 11 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. As we can see the digit 1 appears 4 times, already the digit 7 appears only once. Therefore, the sum of the number of digits 1 and 7 is equal to 5.</p>
<p>You will be given an integer <strong>N</strong>, you must inform Ribeiro the sum of the number of digits <strong>1</strong> with the number of digits <strong>7</strong> that appear between all the numbers <strong>1</strong> through <strong>N</strong>.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input contains an integer <strong>N</strong> (1 &lt;= <strong>N</strong> &lt;= 10 ^ 12).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>The output should show the sum of the number of digits 1 with the number of digits 7, as it explains the problem.</p>
