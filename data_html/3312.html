<p>Guilherme is ten years old and a little math enthusiast, and he recently discovered the existence of the famous prime numbers. With his great interest in the discipline, his teacher Marlene has already taught him some subjects and one of them is factorial. Guilherme loves to exercise and wants to train more to prepare for the Mathematics Olympiad. Marlene passed a list of numbers to Guilherme to solve at home, in which all the prime numbers found must also be found in their respective factorial. Help Guilherme check his exercises and study for the Mathematics Olympiad.</p>
