<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>InÃªs Venezuela has decided to record on CD the videos she sent to <em>GranHermano</em> TV show, one video per CD. After putting each CD in a small square box, she realised that it was possible to organise the CDs in a manner that they would perfectly cover a square table of hers and no CD would be put over another CD.</p>
<p>Ana and Bob are two friends who are big fans of InÃªs Venezuela. They have also sent many videos to <em>GranHermano</em> and also recorded their videos on CDs, one video per CD. However, differently from Panterona (as Brazilians usually call InÃªs Venezuela), they want to organise their videos in knapsacks in a way that:</p>
<ul>
<li>in each knapsack there are only CDs either from Ana or from Bob;</li>
<li>the number <strong>N</strong> of CDs in every knapsack is always the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>They realised that there is not necessarily one possibility for the value of <strong>N</strong>, but, for all the possibilities of values for <strong>N</strong>, it would be also possible to organise all the InÃªs Venezuela's CDs in knapsacks in a way that in each knapsack there would be exactly <strong>N</strong> InÃªs Venezuela's CDs.</p>
<p>Knowing how many videos Ana and Bob have sent to <em>GranHermano</em> each, and knowing that the length of the side of each square box used by InÃªs Venezuela is 1 centimetre, calculate the length of the side of InÃªs Venezuela's square table.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input consists only of two positive integers <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong> â¤ 10<sup>9</sup>), which respectively represent the number of Ana's CDs and the number of Bob's CDs.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>Print how many centimetres long is the side of the Internet Queen's square table. If there is more than one possible answer, print the smallest.</p>
