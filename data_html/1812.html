<p>The Science Academy of Czech Republic, worried about the summer floods in Prague, is fostering the development of a new computational cluster, it has, among other tasks, to make a more accurate weather forecast. This new cluster is composed by m equally machines working in parallel. Because of budget reasons, each machine may process only a task at once, and each task can not be processed in more than one machine simultaneously. The cluster allows, however, pre-emption. In other words, it is possible to interrupt the execution of a task and return it posteriorly, in other machine if necessary.</p>
<p>You've been invited to an Computer Science related event to develop a preliminary version of task scheduler of the cluster, since you were in Prague. In this version, it's provided a set of tasks T, in which one task t â T has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A process requirement p<sub>t</sub> that denotes the number of time units needed to accomplish the task;</li>
<li>A release moment r<sub>t</sub>, that represents the time unit from which the task is available to processing (it could be waiting data, for example);</li>
<li>A value d<sub>t</sub> â¥ p<sub>t </sub>+ r<sub>t</sub>, that indicates the first moment, in time units, in which the task shall, imperatively, be done. In other words, the task t must be held in range [r<sub>t </sub>, d<sub>t</sub>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your scheduler must receive that data, accordingly with the format described below and it must tell if there is or not a viable scheduling, or in other words, a scheduling that completes every task in the time interval allowed.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>
                    Your scheduler must be prepared to work with various instances of input. Each instance follows this format. On the first line are provided the number of machines, 0 â¤ <strong>m</strong> â¤ 100, and tasks, 0 â¤ <strong>n</strong> â¤ 1000, respectively. On the next <strong>n</strong> lines are provided the values <strong>p</strong><sub><strong>t</strong> </sub>â¥<sub> </sub>0, <strong>r</strong><sub><strong>t</strong> </sub>â¥ 0 and <strong>d</strong><sub><strong>t</strong> </sub>â¥ 0 (one triple per line) for the tasks <strong>t</strong> â T. The instants <strong>r<sub>t</sub></strong> and <strong>d<sub>t</sub></strong> are integers, and <strong>p<sub>t</sub></strong> is decimal. Values <strong>m</strong> = 0 and <strong>n</strong> = 0 indicates that the instances processing is finished and there's nothing more to process. All the input values of the same line are separated by any number of empty spaces.
                </p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each solved instance, you must print an identifier Instance h, in which <strong>h</strong> is an integer number, sequential and crescent starting from 1. On the next line it must be printed Viable or Not Viable, depending of the scheduling for the instance if it's viable or not, respectively. An empty line must separate each instance output.</p>
