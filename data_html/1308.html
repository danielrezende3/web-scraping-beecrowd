<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>A troop of Etruscan warriors is organized as follows. In the first row, there is only one warrior; then, the second row contains two warriors; the third row contains three warriors, and so on. In general, each row <em>i</em> contains <em>i</em> warriors.</p>
<p>We know the number of Etruscan warriors of a given troop. You have to compute the number of rows in which they are organized.</p>
<p>Please note that there may be some remaining warriors (this could happen if they are not enough to form the next row). For example, 3 warriors are organized in 2 rows. With 6 warriors you can form 3 rows; but you can also form 3 rows with 7, 8 or 9 warriors.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a single integer <strong>N</strong> (0 â¤ <strong>N</strong> â¤ 10<sup>18</sup>), indicating the number of Etruscan warriors.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case, the output should contain a single integer indicating the number of rows that can be formed.</p>
