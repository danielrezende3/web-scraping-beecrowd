                    Millionaire Mr Smith is well-known -- not for his wealth, but for his odd sense of "art"... Mr Smith has got a circular garden. On the boundary he picks three points and gets a triangle. He then finds the largest circle in that triangular region. So he gets something like this (Please click here for a black-and-white version of the figure):

</p>
<p>Mr Smith then plants yellow sunflowers, blue violets and red roses in the way shown in the figure. (Nice combination, eh? :-) Given the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, you are to find the areas of the regions with each kind of flowers respectively.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>Each line of input contains three integers <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, <strong>c</strong>, the lengths of the three sides of the triangular region, with 0 &lt; <strong>a </strong>â¤ <strong>b </strong>â¤ <strong>c </strong>â¤ 1000. The input is terminated by end of file (EOF). </p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each case, your program should output the areas of the regions with sunflowers, with violets and with roses respectively. Print your answers correct to 4 decimal places.</p>
