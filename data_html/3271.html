<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>Gunnar and Emma play a lot of board games at home, so they own many dice that are not normal 6-sided dice. For example they own a die that has 10 sides with numbers 47, 48, . . . , 56 on it.</p>
<p>There has been a big storm in Stockholm, so Gunnar and Emma have been stuck at home without electricity for a couple of hours. They have finished playing all the games they have, so they came up with a new one. Each player has 2 dice which he or she rolls. The player with a bigger sum wins. If both sums are the same, the game ends in a tie.</p>
</div>
<h2>Task</h2>
<div class="task">
<p>Given the description of Gunnarâs and Emmaâs dice, which player has higher chances of winning?</p>
<p>All of their dice have the following property: each die contains numbers <strong>a</strong>, <strong>a</strong> + 1, . . . , <strong>b</strong>, where <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are the lowest and highest numbers respectively on the die. Each number appears exactly on one side, so the die has <strong>b</strong> â <strong>a</strong> + 1 sides.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>
                    The first line contains four integers <strong>a<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>b<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>a<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>b<sub>2</sub></strong> that describe Gunnarâs dice. Die number <strong>i</strong> contains numbers <strong>a<sub>i</sub></strong>, <strong>a<sub>i</sub></strong> + 1, . . . , <strong>b<sub>i</sub></strong> on its sides. You may assume that 1 â¤ <strong>a<sub>i</sub></strong> â¤ <strong>b<sub>i</sub></strong> â¤ 100. You can further assume that each die has at least four sides, so <strong>a<sub>i</sub></strong> + 3 â¤ <strong>b<sub>i</sub></strong>.
