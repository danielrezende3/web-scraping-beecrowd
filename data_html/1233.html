                    Fernando won a compass for his birthday, and now his favorite hobby is drawing stars: ï¬rst, he marks <strong>N</strong> points on a circumference, dividing it into <strong>N</strong> equal arcs; then, he connects each point to the <em>k-th</em> next point, until returning to the ï¬rst point.<br/>
<br/>
                    Depending on the value of <em>k</em>, Fernando may or may not reach all points marked on the circumference; when that happens, the star is called complete. For example, when <strong>N</strong> = 8, the possible stars are shown in the ï¬gure below. Stars (a) and (c) are complete, while stars (b) and (d) are not.

<br/>
<p>Depending on the value of <strong>N</strong>, it may be possible to draw many diï¬erent stars; Fernando asked you to write a program that, given <strong>N</strong>, determines the number of complete stars he can draw.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case contains a single line, containing a single integer <strong>N</strong> (3 â¤ <strong>N</strong> &lt; 2<sup>31</sup>), indicating the number of arcs in which the circumference was divided.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case, your program must print a single line containing a single integer, indicating the number of complete stars that can be drawn.</p>
