<p>The class of Computer Science of CIn-UFPE 2025.1 is graduating! It is a very special graduation, not only because all major projects of students in this class have become multinational corporations, but also because the number 2025 is a perfect square! Therefore, the students decided to make all numbers of the ceremony a perfect square: dates, number of guests, hash of the name of the class, the amount of students graduating, etc.</p>
<p>The party organizers were able to meet this requirement until the time comes to buy the snacks. They came into boxes with N snacks at a time. If N is not a perfect square, they will have to buy more than one box. Help the party organizers by making a program to calculate the minimum number of snacks they should buy to meet the eccentric requirements of the students.</p>

</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case print a line with "Caso #<strong>X</strong>: <strong>Y</strong>", where <strong>X</strong> is he number of the current case, starting with 1, and <strong>Y</strong> is the minimum number of snacks that the party organizers should buy.</p>
