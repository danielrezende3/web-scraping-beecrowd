<p>Will Bonati live in the city of Belo Air, along with the family of his uncle, Phill Bonati . Will usually does some things that his uncle did not like, such as, for example, listen to music at high volume. One day, Phill poses a challenge to his nephew. He would spend the first numbers of a sequence he created. If Will could find the next number in this sequence, his uncle would have to put up with his music, with high volume, and still make a soup for them. If not discovered, Will would have to stop listening to such songs, leaving the quieter uncle. The first numbers of this sequence are below. Will asked for your help to write a program that can identify the next number in this sequence .</p>
