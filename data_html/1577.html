<p>The investigation of which regular polygons can be constructed only with compass and straightedge is a classical problem in mathematics. Triangle, square, hexagon can easily be constructed, but, can we construct a regular heptagon? It was the German mathematician Gauss (1777-1855) who first proved that one could construct a 17-sided regular polygon and later, in one the of the most beautiful math works of all time (Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, 1798), he gave sufficient conditions to decide which regular polygons can be constructed.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>In the first line, an integer T&lt;50000 representing the number of test cases; then, T integer numbers representing the number of sides of a non-degenerated regular polygon, up to 1000000 (10<sup>6</sup>).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>Print âYesâ if the regular polygon can be constructed with compass and straightedge or âNoâ otherwise.</p>
