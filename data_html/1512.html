<div class="description">
<p>Rafael decided to change the tiles from his living room, and for that he made some measurements and bought <strong>N</strong> white tiles from the store.</p>
<p>The fact that all the tiles are white got Rafael's attention about the design of his living room, and then he decided to paint some of the tiles to give a âmodern airâ to his house.</p>
<p>He positioned all the <strong>N</strong> tiles in a straight line, and enumerated all of them from 1 to <strong>N</strong>, from the left to the right.</p>
<p>To choose which tiles to paint, he thought about the following: Chose two integers <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, and said he was going to paint all the tiles which enumeration was multiple of <strong>A</strong> and/or <strong>B</strong>.</p>
<p>Help Rafael to find out how many tiles are going to be painted at the total.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>There will be several test cases. Each test case has three integers, <strong>N</strong>, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> (3 â¤ <strong>N</strong> â¤ 10â¹, 2 â¤ <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong> â¤ <strong>N</strong>).</p>
<p>The last test case is indicated when <strong>N</strong> = <strong>A</strong> = <strong>B</strong> = 0, which should not be processed.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p> For each test case, print one line containing one integer, representing how many tiles are going to painted.</p>
