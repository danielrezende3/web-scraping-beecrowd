<p>Right now presidential elections are being held in Nlogonia. For a candidate to win in the first round, he should obtain more votes than each of the other candidates. But that is not enough: he should also obtain at least 45% of all the votes, or at least 40% of all the votes and at least 10% more votes than each of the other candidates. This 10% has to be calculated from all votes. If no candidate wins in the first round, a new election is held as a second round.</p>
<p>Benicio is a political journalist in Nlogonia, and he always wants to scoop everyone else. This is why he has collected information from polls, and wants to know if according to these one of the candidates will win in the first round, or on the contrary there will be a second round. Benicio needs to decide this with haste, before someone else scoops him. Can you help him?</p>
