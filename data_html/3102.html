<p>Every Dragon Ball fan knows the famous attack of the character Tenshinhan, KIKOHO. Recently Tenshi, for the intimate, went to battle with the warrior Cell. It was an epic battle, he managed to hit some attacks on Cell, but unfortunately he didn't win it. However, he was satisfied with the total area that his attack covered. Let's say that Tenshi's attack is basically a triangle, he doesn't know what area that attack came to, but he knows where the vertices of the formed triangle are.</p>
<p>Can you help Tenshi telling what is the total area his attack had?</p>
<p>See an exemple of how is his attack and how it looks like a triangle.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The first line of entry contains an integer <strong>N</strong> (1 &lt;= <strong>N</strong> &lt;= 20) representing the number of test cases. The next <strong>N</strong> lines contain 3 pairs of coordinates in the Cartesian plane, (<strong>X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3</strong>) (-700 &lt;= <strong>Xi, Yi</strong> &lt;= 1000), informing the vertices of the triangle that the attack formed after hitting the ground. The given points are guaranteed to form a triangle.</p>
