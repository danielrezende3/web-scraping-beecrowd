<p>Substrings are strings formed by choosing a subset of contiguous characters from a string. This is well known. A little more obscure is the definition of substhreengs. A substhreeng is a substring which complies to the following additional requirements:</p>
<p>1. It is non-empty, and composed entirely of base 10 digits.</p>
<p>2. Interpreted in base 10 (allowing extra leading zeros), the resulting integer is a multiple of 3.</p>
<p>For instance, the string â130a303â contains 9 substhreengs: the substhreeng â3â three times, the substhreengs â30â and â0â twice each, and the substhreengs â303â and â03â once each. The substring â30a3â is not a substhreeng because it is not composed entirely of base 10 digits, while the substring â13â is not a substhreeng because 13 is not a multiple of 3.</p>
<p>Notice that two substhreengs are considered different if they are different in length or start at a different position, even if the selected characters are the same.</p>
<p>Given a string, you are asked to count the number of substhreengs it contains.</p>
