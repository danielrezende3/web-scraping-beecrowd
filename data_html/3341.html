                    JoÃ£ozinho is a pro-player of the mug game. He is used to making huge bets and making astronomical profits.<br/>
                    Of course, it is not so easy to have astronomical profits in such a simple game, for this reason JoÃ£ozinho usually challenges himself with a branch of the mug game.
                </p>
<p>Inside the cup are placed two dice with <strong>D1</strong> and <strong>D2</strong> sides. JoÃ£ozinho chooses a <strong>V</strong> value to bet and then rolls the dice. If the sum of the faces of the dice equals <strong>V</strong>, JoÃ£ozinho wins a lot of money, otherwise he loses.</p>
<p>JoÃ£ozinho's dice are not conventional dice, they have random values and can have sides with the same value. Furthermore, the data is not necessarily the same.</p>
<p>To aid his bet, he asked for your help in figuring out how many different ways there are for the sum of the dice sides to add up to exactly <strong>V</strong>.</p>
<p>JoÃ£ozinho intends to consult you <strong>Q</strong> times to test several possible results.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>In the first line, 3 integers are passed, <strong>D1</strong>, <strong>D2</strong> and <strong>Q</strong>, representing the number of sides of the first dice. The number of sides of the second dice and the number of queries that JoÃ£ozinho will make.</p>
<p>In the next line there will be <strong>D1</strong> integer values between <strong>0</strong> and <strong>10âµ</strong> (<strong>both included</strong>) representing the values on the sides of die 1.</p>
<p>In the subsequent line there will be <strong>D2</strong> integer values between <strong>0</strong> and <strong>10âµ</strong> (<strong>both included</strong>) representing the values on the sides of die 2.</p>
<p>And in the last <strong>Q</strong> lines there will be an integer per line, the number that JoÃ£ozinho wants to consult.</p>
<p>The restrictions for the values are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(1 \leq \textbf{Q} \leq 10^5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(1 \leq \textbf{L} \leq \textbf{R} \leq 10^6\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(1 \leq \textbf{K} \leq 10^6\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each JoÃ£ozinho's query, it is necessary to print an integer representing the number of existing combinations whose sum of the data faces gives exactly <strong>V</strong>.</p>
