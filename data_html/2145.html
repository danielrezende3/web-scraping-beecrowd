<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>A natural number loves another number if the sum of its divisors is a divisor of the other number. For example, 9 loves 12, because the sum of the divisors of 9 is 4, which is a divisor of 12. However, 12 doesn't love 9, because 16 (sum of the divisors of 12) is not a divisor of 9. In this case, 9 loves 12 and is unrequited, which makes it a 'friendzoned' number.</p>
<p>
                    Nevertheless, there are cases in which the love is requited: when the sum of the divisors of a number is equal to or a divisor of the other number and vice versa. On the other hand, an almost requited love occurs when the sum of the divisors of a number is equal to the sum of the divisors of the other number.<br/>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two integers <strong>N</strong> and <strong>M</strong> (2 â¤ <strong>N</strong>, <strong>M</strong> â¤ 10<sup>9</sup>), being <strong>N</strong> and <strong>M</strong> different numbers. Read input until N = M = 0.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>Print the connection between the given numbers, according to the conditions below:</p>
<p>
                    1 - If the love is requited, print "Friends and lovers &lt;3";<br/>
                    2 - If the love is almost requited, print "Almost lovers!";<br/>
                    3 - If the love is unrequited, print "X friendzoned Y!", in which the sum of the divisors of X is different from the sum of the divisors of Y and X is a multiple of the sum of the divisors of Y (Y loves X) but Y is not a multiple of the sum of the divisors of X (X doesn't love Y);<br/>
                    4 - If there's no connection, that is, the sum of the divisors of X is different from the sum of the divisors of Y and X is not a multiple of the sum of the divisors of Y and Y is not a multiple of the sum of the divisors of X, print "No connection.".
                </p>
<p>Note: In this problem, the sum of the divisors doesn't include the number itself, and in the cases in which the love is requited and also almost requited, prevails the requited love.</p>
