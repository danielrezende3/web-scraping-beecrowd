<p>Jaida likes positive integers very much, currently she is playing a game called "multiply game".</p>
<p>"Multiply game" is just an educational game in which you have a list of <em>N</em> numbers. You can take two of them and add the their product to the list. You can do this as many times as you want.</p>
<p>Jaida wants the list to contain all the numbers from 1 to <em>X</em> (with possible repetitions or greater numbers). Help little Jaida telling her what is the maximum value of <em>X</em> she can achieve.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The first line in the input contains a number <strong>T</strong> which is the number of test cases. Every test case is described by 2 lines:</p>
<p>
                    The first line contains number <strong>N</strong> (0 &lt; <strong>N</strong> &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup>) as described in the statement. The second line contains <strong>N</strong> positive integers <strong>a<sub>i</sub></strong>, which are the initial numbers in Jaida's list (0 &lt; <strong>a<sub>i</sub></strong> &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup>).
                </p>
