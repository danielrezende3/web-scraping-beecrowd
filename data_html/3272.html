<div class="description">
<p>For the grand opening of the algorithmic games in NlogNsglow, a row of tower blocks is set to be demolished in a grand demonstration of renewal. Originally the plan was to accomplish this with controlled explosions, one for each tower block, but time constraints now require a hastier solution.</p>
<p>To help you remove the blocks more rapidly you have been given the use of a Universal Kinetic / Incandescent Energy Particle Cannon (UKIEPC). On a single charge, this cutting-edge contraption can remove either all of the floors in a single tower block, or all the <strong>x</strong>-th floors in all the blocks simultaneously, for userâs choice of the floor number <strong>x</strong>. In the latter case, the blocks that are less than <strong>x</strong> floors high are left untouched, while for blocks having more than <strong>x</strong> floors, all the floors above the removed <strong>x</strong>-th one fall down by one level.</p>
</div>
<h2>Task</h2>
<div>
<p>Given the number of floors of all towers, output the minimum number of charges needed to eliminate all floors of all blocks.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>
                    The first line of input contains the number of blocks <strong>n</strong>, where 2 â¤ <strong>n</strong> â¤ 100000. The second line contains <strong>n</strong> consecutive block heights <strong>h<sub>i</sub></strong> for <strong>i</strong> = 1, 2, . . . , <strong>n</strong>, where 1 â¤ <strong>h<sub>i</sub></strong> â¤ 1000000.
                </p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>Output one line containing one integer: the minimum number of charges needed to tear down all the blocks.</p>
