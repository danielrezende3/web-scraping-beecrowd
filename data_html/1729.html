                    A relay is a race for two or more teams of runners. Each member of a team runs one section of the race. Your task is to help to evaluate the results of a relay race. <br/>
                    You have to process several teams. For each team you are given a list with the running times for every section of the race. You are to compute the average time per kilometer over the whole distance. That's easy, isn't it?
                </p>
<p>So if you like the fun and challenge competing at this contest, perhaps you like a relay race, too. Students from Ulm participated e.g. at the "SOLA" relay in Zurich, Switzerland. For more information visit http://www.sola.asvz.ethz.ch/ after the contest is over.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The first line of the input specifies the number of sections <strong>N</strong> followed by the total distance of the relay <strong>D</strong> in kilometers. You may safely assume that 1&lt;=<strong>N</strong>&lt;=20 and 0.0&lt;<strong>D</strong>&lt;200.0. Every following line gives information about one team: the team number <strong>T</strong> (an integer, right-justified in a field of width 3) is followed by the n results for each section, separated by a single space. These running times are given in the format "h:mm:ss" with integer numbers for the hours, minutes and seconds, respectively. In the special case of a runner being disqualified, the running time will be denoted by "-:--:--". Finally, the data on every line is terminated by a newline character. Input is terminated by EOF.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each team output exactly one line giving the team's number t right aligned in a field of width 3, and the average time for this team rounded to whole seconds in the format "m:ss". If at least one of the team's runners has been disqualified, output "-" instead. Adhere to the sample output for the exact format of presentation.</p>
