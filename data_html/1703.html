<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>Petr is playing a game called "Jumping Stones".</p>
<p>In this game, there are N slots in a line numbered from 1 to N. On each slot there is a stone with a number written on its top. The written numbers go from 1 to N and are all different.</p>
<p>Petr starts at slot 1 and takes K steps. At each step, he looks the number written on the current stone and jumps to the slot correspondent to that number.</p>
<p>Given integers N and K, determine among all possible configurations the probability that he will return to slot 1 after K steps. Assume that different configurations has the same probability.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>You will be given <strong>T</strong>, number of test cases, and then <strong>T</strong> lines follow with <strong>N</strong> and <strong>K</strong> from the statement (1 &lt;= <strong>N</strong>,<strong>K</strong> &lt;= 10^5).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case output a single line with the answer. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute erro is less than 0.00001</p>
<p>
<strong>Ps.:</strong> Following the example input For the second case we have the following possibilites: <br/>
                    1 2 3 <br/>
                    1 3 2 <br/>
                    2 1 3 <br/>
                    2 3 1 <br/>
                    3 1 2 <br/>
                    3 2 1 <br/>
                    In the first and second configurations we finish at the slot 1 after 1 step.
