<p>Famous interplanetary traveler, ET Bilu wants to invite people from the planet he is visiting to a Great Party. In Bilu culture, a party can only be considered a Grand Party if at least two participants were born on the same day.</p>
<p>Unlike planet Earth, which has 365 or 366 days each year, the planets Bilu visits have a number of different days.</p>
<p>Even with all the advanced technology of intergalactic travel, Bilu does not know how to calculate the chance that this big event will happen. Therefore, you, who were at a Great Party held on planet Earth, will help Bilu to incorporate a program to estimate the chance of a Great Party on the ship's computer.</p>
<p>Given the number of days per year on the planet Bilu is visiting and the number of people at the party, determine the likelihood that the party will be considered a Great Party.</p>
