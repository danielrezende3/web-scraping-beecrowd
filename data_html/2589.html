<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>Prime gap âârefers to the difference between consecutive prime numbers. For example, the distance between prime ââ7 and 11 is 4, just as the distance between prime ââ23 and 29 is 6. The challenge is, given a number, considering all previous and the number itself, what is the largest distance between Consecutive prime numbers?</p>
<p>Write a program that, given a number, computes the biggest prime gap.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>There will be several test cases. Each test case will have an integer <strong>N</strong> (2 â¤ <strong>N</strong> â¤ 10<sup>9</sup>). The entry ends with end of file.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case, print the largest distance between consecutive cousins, from 1 to <strong>N</strong>.</p>
