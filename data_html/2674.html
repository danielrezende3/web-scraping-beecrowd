<div class="description">
<p>The Association of Indivisible Primes ââelected a category of prime numbers called Super Primes. A number is considered super prime if in addition to being prime, all its digits are prime, too. The Association asked you to make a program to characterize the numbers.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input contains several test cases, each test case being an integer <strong>N</strong> (0 &lt; <strong>N</strong> &lt; 10<sup>5</sup>) on a single line. The entry ends in the last test case.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case, the entry number classification is expected in a single line, which can be: "Super", if the number is a Super Prime; "Primo" if the number by a prime number only; Or "Nada" if the number has divisors beyond 1 and itself.</p>
