                    "Stop thief! Stop thief!" Stole the purse of an innocent lady who was walking on the beach and Nlogonia thief fled toward the sea. His plan seems obvious: he intends to take a boat and escape!<br/>
<br/>
                    The fugitive, who by now is aboard their vessel leakage, intends to follow the coast perpendicularly toward the limit of international waters, which is 12 nautical miles away, where will be saved from local authorities. Your boat can travel that distance at a constant speed of VF us.<br/>
<br/>
                    The Coast Guard intends to intercept him, and your boat has a constant speed of VG us. Assuming both boats departing the coast at exactly the same instant, with a distance of D nautical miles between them, can be possible that the Coast Guard reach the thief before the limit of international waters?<br/>
<br/>
                    Assume the coast of Nlogonia is perfectly straight and the sea calm enough, to allow a trajectory so as retilÃ­Ä±nea the coast.

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>
                    The input consists of several test cases. Each test case is described in a line containing three integers,
                    <strong>D</strong> (1 â¤ <strong>D</strong> â¤ 100), <strong>VF</strong> (1 â¤ <strong>VF</strong> â¤ 100) and <strong>VG</strong> (1 â¤ <strong>VG</strong> â¤ 100), indicating the initial distance between the fugitive and the Coast Guard, the runaway boat speed and the Coast Guard boat speed.
                </p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case print a line containing 'S' if the Coast Guard can reach the fugitive before he exceeds the limit of international waters or 'N' otherwise.</p>
