<p>Dabriel just invented a new game that works as follows: He thinks of an integer <strong>N </strong>and must find the number of maximals* subsets that exist using the numbers from 1 to <strong>N </strong>so that if the number i is chosen for the set, neither <strong>i</strong>-1 nor <strong>i</strong>+1 can appear. For small values Dabriel knows the answer, but with large numbers this task gets very difficult. Can you help him?</p>
<p>For N = 5 the valid sets are: {1,3,5}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {1,4}.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input is composed of several test cases. Each case contains an integer <strong>N</strong> (1 â¤ <strong>N</strong> â¤ 10<sup>18</sup>).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case print the number of existing sets. Since this number can be very large, print only the rest of the division by 10<sup>9</sup>+7.</p>
