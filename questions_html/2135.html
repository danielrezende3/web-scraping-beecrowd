<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>The teacher Cris became known as a machiavellian person in your institution. For those not aware of the situation, the teacher required students to form a queue in lexicographical order (by name) with at most k permutations. This meant that many students do not even enter the room to take the test. However, this selective she resolved to redeem himself against students, and decided to apply a little trouble retrieval.</p>
<p>Your task, even if not disapproved, is given a sequence of n integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>. Where -30 â¤ a<sub>j</sub> â¤ 30 for j = 1, ..., n, print, if there is an integer a<sub>k</sub> such that <img alt="" src="https://resources.beecrowd.com/gallery/images/problems/UOJ_2135.jpg" style="width: 89px; height: 37px"/> . If more than an integer that satisfies this condition, print the first in the sequence.</p>
<p>Note from teacher: "Boys, remember that the sum of any nonzero number is not zero! Okay?"</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The entrance is composed of several instances. The first line of each instance consists of an integer; <strong>n;</strong>(1 â¤ <strong>n </strong>â¤100) indicating the number of integers in the following line should to be processed. The entry ends with end of file.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each instance, you must print an identifier "Instancia <strong>k"</strong>, where <strong>k</strong> is the number of the current instance starting with 1. On the next line print the integer that satisfies the restriction described above. If no such integer exists print "nao achei".</p>
<p>After each instance print a blank line.</p>
