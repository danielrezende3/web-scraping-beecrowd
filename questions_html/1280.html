                    John will help his friend Joseph in a hard and laborious task, but they still not reach an agreement on the Johnâs payment by the aid in the task. After some discussion, John, who is very good at math, proposed the following: initially each one will deï¬ne, without the other knowing it, a certain value, i.e. John will deï¬ne a value n and Joseph will deï¬ne a value m. So if Joseph propose do not to pay anything, then he will have to pay n + 1 dollars! If John say that do not want to receive anything and Joseph propose paying 1 or more dollars, Joseph will pay the same amount that would pay if John had asked for a dollar and Joseph had proposed to pay only m - 1 dollars! If both values are greater than zero, Joseph will pay the same value that would have to pay if he had proposed m - 1 dollars and John wanted to receive the same that would receive if Joseph had proposed to pay m dollars and he had asked for n - 1 dollars!! They also agreed that if Joseph was willing to pay at most 3 dollars,
                    then John could charge up to 200 dollars. On the other hand, if Joseph was willing to pay 4 dollars, then John only could charge up to 2 dollars! After hours discussing these rules, they ï¬nally agreed that it would be too laborious calculate the amount owed by Joseph. So write a program that calculates the amount of dollars Joseph will have to pay to John, according to these rules.

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The ï¬rst line of the input contains an integer <strong>T</strong> that indicates the number of test cases. The <strong>T </strong>following lines contain two integers <strong>m </strong>(0 â¤ <strong>m </strong>â¤ 4) and <strong>n </strong>(0 â¤ <strong>n </strong>â¤ 200), separated by a space, representing the values that Joseph want to pay and John want to receive, respectively.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>The output should contain, for each test case, an integer equal to the value that Joseph will have to pay to John.</p>
