<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>So so far away there is a pacific kingdom called LÃ¡-Ara. LÃ¡-Ara leader, the king Naldo, a great pokemon master, is in trouble. A rare mathematician pokemon called Evil-Son invades his territory and it threatened to destroy everything if nobody answer the challenge described as follow.</p>
<p>
                    A set of lines in the pane is said to be in <em>general position</em>
                    if no two lines are parallel and no three lines intersect at a common point. Inside the rectangle of figure (A) we have a set of lines in general position, in other hand, inside the rectangle of figure (B) we have represented a set of lines that isn't in general position.

<p>The challenge consists in compute the number of regions in the plane created by a set of <strong>N</strong> lines in general position. The king Naldo needs your mathematics and programming skills to save the LÃ¡-Ara kingdom of evil Evil-Son.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input consists of many instances of the problem. The first line contains just an integer <strong>T</strong> that represents the number of instances.</p>
<p>
                    Each instance consists of one line thats has the number <strong>N</strong>
                    representing the number of lines in the set.
                </p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each instance in the input, prints a line with the number of regions created in the plane by the lines in the set.</p>
