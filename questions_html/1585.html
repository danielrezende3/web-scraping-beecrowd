<div class="description">
<p>Anastasia really loves to build kites to her friends. Peter, knowing that, took some bamboo pieces from the furniture factory of his uncle that it would be descarted, to give to Anastasia. When Peter gave the bamboos to her, he asked what was the biggest kite that could be built with those patches of bamboo. Anastasia, that is not very good with calculus, wants you to help her with this task.</p>
<p>Note .: Each kite is built with two pieces of bamboo tied cross-shaped, forming a lozenge.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input contains many test cases. The first line of input contains an integer <strong>N </strong>that represents the among of kites that will be built. Each one of the <strong>N</strong> following lines contains two integer numbers <strong>x</strong> (10 â¤ <strong>x</strong> â¤ 100) and <strong>y</strong> (10 â¤ <strong>y</strong> â¤ 100) that indicates the size of the two bambus used to built the kite.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case, print a truncate integer number corresponding to the area of the kite created, in cm<sup>2</sup>, followed by a blank space and the text "cm2", without the quotes.</p>
