<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>1 is a divisor of 6. In addition to 1, it has 3 more divisors of 6: 2, 3 and 6. In total, 6 has 4 divisors, and it is the smallest number that has 4 divisors. Talking about divisor, given a number n, what is the smallest number that has n divisors?</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input is composed of several test cases. The first line contains an integer C, with the total of test cases. The following C lines have an integer N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each input test case in your program, you must print an integer containing the smallest number that has N divisors. Some values ââwill have relatively large numbers. In this way, print in the form of MOD 1000000007</p>
