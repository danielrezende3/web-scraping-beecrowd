<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>All the positive numbers can be expressed as a sum of one, two or more consecutive positive integers. For example 9 can be expressed in three such ways, 2+3+4, 4+5 or 9. Given an integer less than (9*10<sup>14</sup>+1) or (9E<sup>14</sup> + 1) or (9*10<sup>14</sup> +1) you will have to determine in how many ways that number can be expressed as summation of consecutive numbers.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input file contains less than 1100 lines of input. Each line contains a single integer <strong>N</strong> (0 â¤ <strong>N</strong> â¤ 9E<sup>14</sup>). Input is terminated by end of file.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer which tells in how many ways <strong>N</strong> can be expressed as summation of consecutive integers.</p>
