<div class="description">
<p>Prof. Cedrado-Cueta likes to play with numbers, and he is particularly fond of perfect squares. A natural number <em>n</em> is said to be a perfect square if there exists a natural number <em>m</em> such that <em>n</em> = <em>m</em><sup>2</sup>. For example, 9 and 36 are perfect squares because 9 = 3<sup>2</sup> and 36 = 6<sup>2</sup>, whereas 5 and 12 are not perfect squares.</p>
<p>The Prof. recently found a number <em>x</em>, and he would like to create a perfect square using it. In order to do so, he will reorder the digits of <em>x</em> to form some number <em>y</em>, and then calculate <em>n</em> = <em>x</em> + <em>y</em>. In how many ways is it possible for him to obtain a perfect square as the value of <em>n</em>? For example, if <em>x</em> = 29 the Prof. can take <em>y</em> = 92, so that <em>n</em> = 29 + 92 = 121 = 11<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Note that when reordering the digits of <em>x</em> the Prof. should use all its digits and obtain a correct expression for the number <em>y</em>, i.e. there can be no leading 0's in <em>y</em>. Also note that he may choose to keep the digits of <em>x</em> in the same order, effectively getting for <em>y</em> the same value as <em>x</em>.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input consists of a single line containing one positive integer number <em>x</em> with at most 12 digits.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>The output consists of a single line containing one integer number representing the number of ways in which the Prof. can obtain a perfect square as the value of <em>n</em>. Two ways are considered different if they differ in the value of <em>n</em> obtained.</p>
