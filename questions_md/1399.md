# Problem 1399

Descrição
----------

Write a program to transform an array A[1], A[2],..., A[n] according to m instructions. Each instruction (L, R, v, p) means: First, calculate how many numbers from A[L] to A[R] (inclusive) are strictly less than v, call this answer k. Then, change the value of A[p] to u\*k/(R - L + 1), here we use integer division (i.e. ignoring fractional part).

Input
-----

The first line of input contains three integer **n**, **m**, **u** ( 1 â¤ **n** â¤ 300,000, 1 â¤ **m** â¤ 50,000, 1 â¤ **u** â¤ 1,000,000,000). Each of the next **n** lines contains an integer **A**[i](1 â¤ **A**[i] â¤ **u**). Each of the next **m** lines contains an instruction consisting of four integers **L**, **R**, **v**, **p** ( 1 â¤ **L** â¤ **R** â¤ **n**, 1 â¤ **v** â¤ **u**, 1 â¤ **p** â¤ **n**).

Output
------

Print **n** lines, one for each integer, the final array.


| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| --- | --- |
| 10 1 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 8 6 10 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 6 |

Explanation: There is only one instruction: L = 2, R = 8, v = 6, p = 10. There are 4 numbers (2,3,4,5) less than 6, so k = 4. The new number in A[10] is 11\*4/(8 - 2 + 1) = 44/7 = 6. I/O by Neilor.
