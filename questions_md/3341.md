# Problem 3341

Descrição
----------

JoÃ£ozinho is a pro-player of the mug game. He is used to making huge bets and making astronomical profits.  

Of course, it is not so easy to have astronomical profits in such a simple game, for this reason JoÃ£ozinho usually challenges himself with a branch of the mug game.

Inside the cup are placed two dice with **D1** and **D2** sides. JoÃ£ozinho chooses a **V** value to bet and then rolls the dice. If the sum of the faces of the dice equals **V**, JoÃ£ozinho wins a lot of money, otherwise he loses.

JoÃ£ozinho's dice are not conventional dice, they have random values and can have sides with the same value. Furthermore, the data is not necessarily the same.

To aid his bet, he asked for your help in figuring out how many different ways there are for the sum of the dice sides to add up to exactly **V**.

JoÃ£ozinho intends to consult you **Q** times to test several possible results.

Input
-----

In the first line, 3 integers are passed, **D1**, **D2** and **Q**, representing the number of sides of the first dice. The number of sides of the second dice and the number of queries that JoÃ£ozinho will make.

In the next line there will be **D1** integer values between **0** and **10âµ** (**both included**) representing the values on the sides of die 1.

In the subsequent line there will be **D2** integer values between **0** and **10âµ** (**both included**) representing the values on the sides of die 2.

And in the last **Q** lines there will be an integer per line, the number that JoÃ£ozinho wants to consult.

The restrictions for the values are as follows:

* \(1 \leq \textbf{Q} \leq 10^5\)
* \(1 \leq \textbf{L} \leq \textbf{R} \leq 10^6\)
* \(1 \leq \textbf{K} \leq 10^6\)

Output
------

For each JoÃ£ozinho's query, it is necessary to print an integer representing the number of existing combinations whose sum of the data faces gives exactly **V**.
