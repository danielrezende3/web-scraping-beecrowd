# Problem 1531

Descrição
----------

The famous Fibonacci sequence can be defined as follows:

* Fib( 1 ) = Fib( 2 ) = 1
* Fib( N ) = Fib( N-1 ) + Fib( N-2 ), for N > 2

Your task is simple, calculate the value of the remainder of Fib ( Fib ( N ) ) divided by M.

Input
-----

The input consists of several test cases and ends with EOF. Each test case consists of a line with two integers **N**and **M** (1 â¤ **N** â¤ 109, 2 â¤ **M** â¤ 106).

Output
------

For each test case, print a line containing an integer equal to the remainder of Fib ( Fib ( **N** ) ) divided by **M**.
