# Problem 1662

Descrição
----------

Assume you have a square of size n that is divided into nÃn positions just as a checkerboard. Two positions (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), where 1 â¤ x1,y1,x2,y2 â¤ n, are called "independent" if they occupy different rows and different columns, that is, x1â x2 and y1â y2. More generally, n positions are called independent if they are pairwise independent. It follows that there are n! different ways to choose n independent positions.

Assume further that a number is written in each position of such an nÃn square. This square is called "homogeneous" if the sum of the numbers written in n independent positions is the same, no matter how the positions are chosen. Write a program to determine if a given square is homogeneous!

Input
-----

The input contains several test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer **n** (1 â¤ **n** â¤ 1000). Each of the next **n** lines contains **n** numbers, separated by exactly one space character. Each number is an integer from the interval [-1000000,1000000].

The last test case is followed by a zero.

Output
------

For each test case output whether the specified square is homogeneous or not. Adhere to the format shown in the sample output.


| Sample Input | Sample Output |
