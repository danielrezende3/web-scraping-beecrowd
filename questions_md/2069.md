# Problem 2069

Descrição
----------

InÃªs Venezuela has decided to record on CD the videos she sent to *GranHermano* TV show, one video per CD. After putting each CD in a small square box, she realised that it was possible to organise the CDs in a manner that they would perfectly cover a square table of hers and no CD would be put over another CD.

Ana and Bob are two friends who are big fans of InÃªs Venezuela. They have also sent many videos to *GranHermano* and also recorded their videos on CDs, one video per CD. However, differently from Panterona (as Brazilians usually call InÃªs Venezuela), they want to organise their videos in knapsacks in a way that:

* in each knapsack there are only CDs either from Ana or from Bob;
* the number **N** of CDs in every knapsack is always the same.

They realised that there is not necessarily one possibility for the value of **N**, but, for all the possibilities of values for **N**, it would be also possible to organise all the InÃªs Venezuela's CDs in knapsacks in a way that in each knapsack there would be exactly **N** InÃªs Venezuela's CDs.

Knowing how many videos Ana and Bob have sent to *GranHermano* each, and knowing that the length of the side of each square box used by InÃªs Venezuela is 1 centimetre, calculate the length of the side of InÃªs Venezuela's square table.

Input
-----

The input consists only of two positive integers **A** and **B** (**A**, **B** â¤ 109), which respectively represent the number of Ana's CDs and the number of Bob's CDs.

Output
------

Print how many centimetres long is the side of the Internet Queen's square table. If there is more than one possible answer, print the smallest.
