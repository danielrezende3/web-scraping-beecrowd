Prime gap âârefers to the difference between consecutive prime numbers. For example, the distance between prime ââ7 and 11 is 4, just as the distance between prime ââ23 and 29 is 6. The challenge is, given a number, considering all previous and the number itself, what is the largest distance between Consecutive prime numbers?

Write a program that, given a number, computes the biggest prime gap.

Input
-----

There will be several test cases. Each test case will have an integer **N** (2 â¤ **N** â¤ 109). The entry ends with end of file.

Output
------

For each test case, print the largest distance between consecutive cousins, from 1 to **N**.
