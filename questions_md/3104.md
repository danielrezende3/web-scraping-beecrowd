# Problem 3104

Descrição
----------

John was previously settling all the questions proposed by his colleague, which made him very angry. Such a "colleague" believed that John was getting the questions right because the first number, in this case **A**, was not so big. So, he took a sheet and filled it whole, with just one number, representing **A**. As he thought it would be impossible to discover such an answer with this gigantic number, he asked one of his friends to choose a second number, this time without exaggeration, to represent **B**.

As John knows many mathematical theories, this challenge was not at all difficult for him and he found the rest of the **A** Ã· **B** division with all the precision and certainty of the world.

Your task is to report the number that John found by calculating the remainder of the division of **A** Ã· **B**, since you are the only person he told the answer to.

Input
-----

The input contains two numbers **A** (1 <= **A** <= 10 ^ 100000) and **B** (1 <= **B** <= 10 ^ 9).

Output
------

The output contains a single integer which is the remainder of the division of **A** Ã· **B**.
