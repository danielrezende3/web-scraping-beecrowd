# Problem 3079

Descrição
----------

After many complaints on city hall, residents of a specific street will finally have their houses illuminated. To make it possible will be necessary to build a pole network on this street obeying the following constraints:

* any two adjacent poles have a distance ***k***between them;
* there should be at least one pole in front of each house.

The street has ***N*** houses and is considered a strait line. A house is represented by a segment of the street and a pole is said to be in front of this house if it is inside this segment. The ***i***-th house means the segment between ***Ai***  and ***Ai***+1 - 1, inclusive, where 1 â¤ ***i*** < ***N***, and the last house means the segment between ***AN*** and ***M***, inclusive.

The city mayor intends to minimize the number of poles that should be installed by maximizing the distance ***k***. Write a program that finds the biggest distance ***k*** that satisfies the above constraints.

Input
-----

The first line of the input contains two integers  ***N*** and ***M*** (2 â¤ ***N*** â¤ 103,2 â¤ ***M*** â¤ 105), which describes the number of houses and the length of the street, respectively. The second line contains ***N*** integers ***Ai***  (0 â¤ ***Ai*** < ***M***; ***Ai***  < ***Ai***+1 for all 1 â¤ ***i*** < ***N***), which represents the coordinates of the beginning of each house in the street. It is guaranteed that ***A1*** = 0.

Output
------

The output contains just one line with an integer ***k***, that means the biggest possible distance between two adjacent poles obeying the above constraints.
