# Problem 2145

Descrição
----------

A natural number loves another number if the sum of its divisors is a divisor of the other number. For example, 9 loves 12, because the sum of the divisors of 9 is 4, which is a divisor of 12. However, 12 doesn't love 9, because 16 (sum of the divisors of 12) is not a divisor of 9. In this case, 9 loves 12 and is unrequited, which makes it a 'friendzoned' number.

Nevertheless, there are cases in which the love is requited: when the sum of the divisors of a number is equal to or a divisor of the other number and vice versa. On the other hand, an almost requited love occurs when the sum of the divisors of a number is equal to the sum of the divisors of the other number.  


Input
-----

The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two integers **N** and **M** (2 â¤ **N**, **M** â¤ 109), being **N** and **M** different numbers. Read input until N = M = 0.

Output
------

Print the connection between the given numbers, according to the conditions below:

1 - If the love is requited, print "Friends and lovers <3";  

2 - If the love is almost requited, print "Almost lovers!";  

3 - If the love is unrequited, print "X friendzoned Y!", in which the sum of the divisors of X is different from the sum of the divisors of Y and X is a multiple of the sum of the divisors of Y (Y loves X) but Y is not a multiple of the sum of the divisors of X (X doesn't love Y);  

4 - If there's no connection, that is, the sum of the divisors of X is different from the sum of the divisors of Y and X is not a multiple of the sum of the divisors of Y and Y is not a multiple of the sum of the divisors of X, print "No connection.".

Note: In this problem, the sum of the divisors doesn't include the number itself, and in the cases in which the love is requited and also almost requited, prevails the requited love.
