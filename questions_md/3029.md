# Problem 3029

Descrição
----------

We are definitely not going to bother you with another generic story when Alice finds about an array or  

when Alice and Bob play some stupid game. This time youâll get a simple, plain text.

First, let us define several things. We define function **F** on the array **A** such that **F**(**i**, 1) = **A**[**i**] and  

F (i, m) = A[F (**i**, **m** â 1)] for **m** > 1. In other words, value **F** (**i**, **m**) represents composition **A**[...**A**[**i**]]  

applied **m** times.

You are given an array of length **N** with non-negative integers. You are expected to give an answer on **Q** queries. Each query consists of two numbers â **m** and **y**. For each query determine how many **x** exist such that **F**(**x**, **m**) = **y**.

Input
-----

The first line contains one integer **N** (1 â¤ **N** â¤ 2 Â· 105 ) â the size of the array **A**. The next line contains **N** non-negative integers â the array **A** itself (1 â¤ **Ai** â¤ **N** ). The next line contains one integer **Q** (1 â¤ **Q** â¤ 105 ) â the number of queries. Each of the next **Q** lines contain two integers m and **y** (1 â¤ **m** â¤ 1018 , 1 â¤ **y** â¤ **N** ).

Output
------

Output exactly **Q** lines with a single integer in each that represent the solution. Output the solutions in the order the queries were asked in.
