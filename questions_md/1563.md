# Problem 1563

Descrição
----------

Choosing randomly two integers A and B between 1 and N inclusive, what is the chance that the number B is less than or equal to the remainder of N divided by A?

For example, for N = 5, there are 25 possible choices for (A, B), but the only pairs that satisfy the condition are (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) and (4,1). Therefore, for N = 5 the probability is 4/25.

Input
-----

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing an integer **N** (1 â¤ **N** â¤ 108).

Output
------

For each test, the output consists of a line containing the irreducible fraction that answers the given question.
