# Problem 2500

Descrição
----------

William recently learned some properties of the bit to bit operator xor (represented by the operator '^' in C language ). He realized that he can do many interesting algorithms with it: Find lonely elements in a sequence, exchange values ââwithout auxiliary variable, encryption and many others. Then he began to experiment and decided to name an operation using xor with its name, the w-xor. The w-xor operation is performed on a sequence of values. Example: it is an **S**={a1, a2, a3, a4}, applying w-xor over the sequence **S** once is equivalent to:

a1= a1^a2^a3^a4

a2= a1^a2^a3^a4

a3= a1^a2^a3^a4

a4= a1^a2^a3^a4

a1= a1^a2^a3^a4

If **S**={a1, a2, a3, a4, a5} then applying w-xor over **S** once is:

a1= a1^a2^a3^a4^a5

a2= a1^a2^a3^a4^a5

a3= a1^a2^a3^a4^a5

a4= a1^a2^a3^a4^a5

a5= a1^a2^a3^a4^a5

a1= a1^a2^a3^a4^a5  


Given a sequence **S** and applying w-xor **M** times over it, you would know what the value of the **K**-th position?

Input
-----

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with three integers 2 â¤ **N** â¤ 103, 1 â¤ **M** â¤ 106  and 1 â¤ **K** â¤ **N** representing the number of elements of the sequence, the number of w-xor operations applied and the position of the value to be found (note that the first position is 1), respectively. On the next line, there will be **N** integer values ââ-109 â¤ **A****i** â¤ 109. The entry ends when **N=M=K=0**.

Output
------

The output consists of one line per test case containing the value of the **K**-th position of the sequence after applied **M** times the w-xor on it.
