# Problem 3026

Descrição
----------

Alice became interested in periods of integer numbers. We say positive X integer number is periodic with length L if there exists positive integer number P with L digits such that X can be written as P P P P. . . P .

For example:

**X** = 123123123 is periodic number with length **L** = 3 and **L** = 9

**X** = 42424242 is periodic number with length **L** = 2, **L** = 4 and **L** = 8

**X** = 12345 is periodic number with length **L** = 5

For given positive period length **L** and positive integer number **A**, Alice wants to find smallest integer number **X** strictly greater than A that is periodic with length **L**.

Input
-----

First line contains one positive integer number **L** (1 â¤ **L** â¤ 105 ) representing length of the period. Second line contains one positive integer number **A** (1 â¤ **A** â¤ 10100000).

Output
------

One positive integer number representing smallest positive number that is periodic with length **L** and is greater than **A**.
