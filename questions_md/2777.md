# Problem 2777

Descrição
----------

Dabriel just invented a new game that works as follows: He thinks of an integer **N** and must find the number of maximals\* subsets that exist using the numbers from 1 to **N** so that if the number i is chosen for the set, neither **i**-1 nor **i**+1 can appear. For small values Dabriel knows the answer, but with large numbers this task gets very difficult. Can you help him?

For N = 5 the valid sets are: {1,3,5}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {1,4}.

Input
-----

The input is composed of several test cases. Each case contains an integer **N** (1 â¤ **N** â¤ 1018).

Output
------

For each test case print the number of existing sets. Since this number can be very large, print only the rest of the division by 109+7.


| Input Sample | Output Sample |
| --- | --- |
| 1 5 30 | 1 4 4410 |

\* A maximal set S is a set where it is not possible to include any other element in it, that is, it has the largest possible size.
