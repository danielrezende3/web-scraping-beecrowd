# Problem 2828

Descrição
----------

An anagram is a permutation of the letters in a word.  

For instance, the strings **ananab** and **anbana** are anagrams of the word **banana**.

Your task, in this problem, is to compute how many distinct anagrams exist for a given word.

Since this number can be very large, compute the remainder of the division of the number of anagrams by our favorite prime number: \(10^9+7\).

Input
-----

The input has a single line, with a single word, with at most \(10^5\) characters. The word only has lowercase characters from **a** to **z**.

Output
------

The output contains only a single line with a single integer, the result.
