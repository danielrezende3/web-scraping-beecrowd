<p>Signals of most probably extra-terrestrial origin have been received and digitized by The Aeronautic and Space Administration (that must be going through a defiant phase: "But I want to use feet, not meters!"). Each signal seems to come in two parts: a sequence of n integer values and a non-negative integer t. We'll not go into details, but researchers found out that a signal encodes two integer values. These can be found as the lower and upper bound of a subrange of the sequence whose absolute value of its sum is closest to t.</p>
<p>You are given the sequence of n integers and the non-negative target t. You are to find a non-empty range of the sequence (i.e. a continuous subsequence) and output its lower index l and its upper index u. The absolute value of the sum of the values of the sequence from the l<sup>th</sup> to the u<sup>th</sup> element (inclusive) must be at least as close to t as the absolute value of the sum of any other non-empty range.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts with two numbers <strong>n</strong> (1 â¤ <strong>n</strong> â¤ 10<sup>5</sup>) and <strong>k</strong>. Input is terminated by <strong>n</strong> = <strong>k</strong> = 0. Otherwise, follows <strong>n</strong> integers with absolute values lower than 10<sup>4</sup> which constitute the sequence. Then follows <strong>k</strong> queries for this sequence. Each query is a target <strong>t</strong> (0 â¤ <strong>t</strong> â¤ 10<sup>9</sup>).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each query output 3 numbers on a line: some closest absolute sum and the lower and upper indices of some range where this absolute sum is achieved. Possible indices start with 1 and go up to <strong>n</strong>.</p>
