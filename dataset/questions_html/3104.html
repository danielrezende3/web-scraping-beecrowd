<div class="description">
<p>John was previously settling all the questions proposed by his colleague, which made him very angry. Such a "colleague" believed that John was getting the questions right because the first number, in this case <strong>A</strong>, was not so big. So, he took a sheet and filled it whole, with just one number, representing <strong>A</strong>. As he thought it would be impossible to discover such an answer with this gigantic number, he asked one of his friends to choose a second number, this time without exaggeration, to represent <strong>B</strong>.</p>
<p>As John knows many mathematical theories, this challenge was not at all difficult for him and he found the rest of the <strong>A</strong> Ã· <strong>B</strong> division with all the precision and certainty of the world.</p>
<p>Your task is to report the number that John found by calculating the remainder of the division of <strong>A</strong> Ã· <strong>B</strong>, since you are the only person he told the answer to.</p>
