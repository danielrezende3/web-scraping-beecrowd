<p>Some students are members of a club that travels annually to exotic locations. Their destinations in the past have included Indianapolis, Phoenix, Nashville, Philadelphia, San Jose, and Atlanta. This spring they are planning a trip to Eindhoven. The group agrees in advance to share expenses equally, but it is not practical to have them share every expense as it occurs. So individuals in the group pay for particular things, like meals, hotels, taxi rides, plane tickets, etc. After the trip, each student's expenses are tallied and money is exchanged so that the net cost to each is the same, to within one cent. In the past, this money exchange has been tedious and time consuming. Your job is to compute, from a list of expenses, the minimum amount of money that must change hands in order to equalize (within a cent) all the students' costs.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>
                    The input will contain the information for several trips. The information for each trip consists of a line containing a positive integer <strong>n</strong> (1 â¤ <strong>n </strong>â¤ 1000) indicating the number of students on the trip, followed by <strong>n</strong> lines of input, each containing the amount, in dollars and cents spent by a student. No student spent more than $10,000.00.<br/>
<br/>
                    A single line containing 0 follows the information for the last trip.
