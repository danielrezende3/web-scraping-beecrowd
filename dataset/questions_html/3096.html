<div class="description">
<p>Ribeiro is very fond of factorial numbers, but recently he was calculating the factorial of some numbers and was not able to arrive at the final answer, since the number that was forming was with many digits and not even his calculator was able to help him.<br/></p>
<p>The factorial of a number <strong>N</strong> is defined by <strong>N</strong>! = 1 * 2 * 3 * .. * <strong>N</strong>.<br/></p>
<p>As Ribeiro saw that in many cases that he would try to find the factorial would result in overflow, he was content to know how many digits the factorial of <strong>N</strong> has.<br/></p>
<p>Example: 5! is equal to 120, so the number of digits is 5! is 3.<br/></p>
<p>Your task is to help Ribeiro and inform how many digits there is <strong>N</strong>!.<br/></p>
