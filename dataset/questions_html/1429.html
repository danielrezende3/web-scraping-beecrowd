<div class="description">
<p>Mathew, an engineering freshman, is developing an original positional notation for representing integer numbers. He called it âA Curious Methodâ (ACM for short). The ACM notation uses the same digits as the decimal notation, i.e., 0 through 9.</p>
<p>
                    To convert a number A from ACM to decimal notation you must add <em>k</em> terms, where <em>k</em> is the number of digits of <em>A</em> (in the ACM notation). The value of the <em>i</em>-th term, corresponding the <em>i</em>-th digit <em>a<sub>i</sub></em>, counting from right to left, is <em>a<sub>i</sub></em> Ã <em>i</em>!. For instance 719<em><sub>ACM</sub></em> is equivalent to 53<sub>10</sub>, since 7 Ã 3! + 1 Ã 2! + 9 Ã 1! = 53.
                </p>
<p>Mathew has just begun studying number theory, and probably does not know which properties a numbering system should have, but at the moment he is only interested in converting a number from ACM to decimal. Could you help him?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>Each test case is given in a single line that contains a non-empty string of at most 5 digits, representing a number in ACM notation. The string does not have leading zeros.</p>
<p>The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test case output a single line containing the decimal representation of the corresponding ACM number.</p>
