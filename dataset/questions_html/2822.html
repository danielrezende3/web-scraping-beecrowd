<p>Happy Birthday! As a birthday gift, your mother made your biggest dream come true and gave you a little pet graph. It's breed is very rare: it has n vertices and each one of them has a value. Initially the vertice i has value i ( 1&lt;= i &lt;= n) and for each pair of vertices the is an edge connecting them with weight equal to the magnitude of the difference of their values.</p>
<p>You little graph is in its development stage, that means that the value of vertice i can change to k at any time! Besides that, graphs eat a lot and you must feed them daily with an amount of food equal to the weight of their<strong> maximum </strong>spanning tree.</p>
<p>Write a program to take good care of your graph, or your mother might take it from you!</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The maximum spanning tree of a graph is the tree which vertices are vertices of the original graph and edges are edges of the original graph that has the maximum sum of weight of it's edges.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The first line of input is an integer <strong>t</strong> (<strong>t</strong>&lt;=10): the number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each case starts with an integer <strong> N</strong> (0&lt;=<strong>N</strong>&lt;=2*10<sup>5</sup>): the number of vertices of the graph.</p>
<p>The next line will be an integer <strong>Q</strong> (1&lt;=<strong>Q</strong>&lt;=2*10<sup>5</sup>) : the number of instructions to be followed.</p>
<p>An instruction can be of the following types:</p>
<p><strong>1 i k </strong>: the value of vertice <strong>i</strong> (1 &lt;= <strong>i</strong> , <strong>k</strong> &lt;= <strong>n</strong>) changes to <strong>k</strong> ( the edges connected to it must change accordingly).</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> : the weight of the maximum spanning tree of your graph.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each instruction of the type 2, print the weight of the maximum spanning tree of the graph.</p>
