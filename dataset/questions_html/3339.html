<div class="description">
<p>Professor Karina usually teaches Discrete Mathematics classes for the Computer Science course. During online classes, she suspected that her students weren't paying attention and decided to take an exam/competition on kahoot.</p>
<p>As the class of the day was about <strong>perfect squares</strong>, in each test/competition question she would give an interval [<strong>L</strong>, <strong>R</strong>] (<strong>limits included</strong>) and would like to know how many <strong>perfect squares</strong> exist within the given interval.</p>
<p>Just to remind you, a <strong>perfect square</strong> is an integer square root number. Ex: <em>0</em>, <em>1</em>, <em>4</em> and <em>9</em>.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>In the first line, an integer <strong>Q</strong> is passed representing the number of questions in the test/competition. In the next <strong>Q</strong> rows there will be two integers <strong>L</strong>, <strong>R</strong> in each row representing the limits.</p>
<p>The restrictions for the values are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(1 \leq \textbf{Q} \leq 10^3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(0 \leq \textbf{L} \leq \textbf{R} \leq 10^{8}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each question it is necessary to print an integer representing the number of <strong>perfect squares</strong> within the range [<strong>L</strong>, <strong>R</strong>] (<strong>limits included</strong>).</p>
