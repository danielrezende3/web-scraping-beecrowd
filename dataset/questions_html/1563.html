<div class="problem">
<div class="description">
<p>Choosing randomly two integers A and B between 1 and N inclusive, what is the chance that the number B is less than or equal to the remainder of N divided by A?</p>
<p>For example, for N = 5, there are 25 possible choices for (A, B), but the only pairs that satisfy the condition are (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) and (4,1). Therefore, for N = 5 the probability is 4/25.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing an integer <strong>N</strong> (1 â¤ <strong>N</strong> â¤ 10<sup>8</sup>).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>For each test, the output consists of a line containing the irreducible fraction that answers the given question.</p>
