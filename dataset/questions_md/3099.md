# Problem 3099

Descrição
----------

Ribeiro, after the defeat of the Brazilian team by 7 x 1 in 2014, has serious problems with these two digits. Now every number he sees, he wants to know how many digits **1** and how many digits **7** appear in all the numbers **1** through **N**, inclusive.

He knows that you are a great programmer and will help you. To "facilitate" his life, Ribeiro said he wants to know only the sum of the number of digits **1** with the number of digits **7** that appear between all the numbers from **1** to **N**, inclusive.

For example, think of the number 11: The numbers 1 through 11 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. As we can see the digit 1 appears 4 times, already the digit 7 appears only once. Therefore, the sum of the number of digits 1 and 7 is equal to 5.

You will be given an integer **N**, you must inform Ribeiro the sum of the number of digits **1** with the number of digits **7** that appear between all the numbers **1** through **N**.

Input
-----

The input contains an integer **N** (1 <= **N** <= 10 ^ 12).

Output
------

The output should show the sum of the number of digits 1 with the number of digits 7, as it explains the problem.
