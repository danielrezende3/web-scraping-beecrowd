# Problem 1492

Descrição
----------

Carl is right now the happiest child in the world: he has just learned this morning what the binary system is. He learned, for instance, that the binary representation of a positive integer k is a string ananâ1 Â· Â· Â· a1a0 where each ai is a binary digit 0 or 1, starting with an = 1, and such that k= Î£ni=0 ai Ã 2i. It is really nice to see him turning decimal numbers into binary numbers, and then adding and even multiplying them.

Caesar is Carlâs older brother, and he just canât stand to see his little brother so happy. So he has prepared a challenge: âLook Carl, I have an easy question for you: I will give you two integers A and B, and you have to tell me how many 1âs there are in the binary representation of all the integers from A to B, inclusive. Get readyâ. Carl agreed to the challenge.

After a few minutes, he came back with a list of the binary representation of all the integers from 1 to 100. âCaesar, Iâm readyâ. Caesar smiled and said: âWell, let me see, I chooseA = 1015 and B = 1016. Your list will not be usefulâ

Carl hates loosing to his brother so he needs a better solution fast. Can you help him?

Input
-----

The input consists of many test cases and ends with EOF. Each test case consist in a single line that contains two integers **A** and **B** (1 â¤ **A** â¤ **B** â¤ 1016).

Output
------

For each test case, print a line with an integer representing the total number of digits 1 in the binary representation of all the integers from **A** to **B**, inclusive.
