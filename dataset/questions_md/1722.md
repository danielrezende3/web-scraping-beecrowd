# Problem 1722

Descrição
----------

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers:

f1 = 1

f2 = 2

fn = fn-1 + fn-2         (n â¥ 3)

Given two numbers a and b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range [a,b].

Input
-----

The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two non-negative integer numbers **a** and **b**. Input is terminated by **a** = **b** = 0.Otherwise, **a** â¤  **b**  â¤10100. The numbers **a** and **b** are given with no superfluous leading zeros.

Output
------

For each test case output on a single line the number of Fibonacci numbers **fi** with **a** â¤ **fi** â¤ **b**.
