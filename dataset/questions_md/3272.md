# Problem 3272

Descrição
----------

For the grand opening of the algorithmic games in NlogNsglow, a row of tower blocks is set to be demolished in a grand demonstration of renewal. Originally the plan was to accomplish this with controlled explosions, one for each tower block, but time constraints now require a hastier solution.

To help you remove the blocks more rapidly you have been given the use of a Universal Kinetic / Incandescent Energy Particle Cannon (UKIEPC). On a single charge, this cutting-edge contraption can remove either all of the floors in a single tower block, or all the **x**-th floors in all the blocks simultaneously, for userâs choice of the floor number **x**. In the latter case, the blocks that are less than **x** floors high are left untouched, while for blocks having more than **x** floors, all the floors above the removed **x**-th one fall down by one level.

Task
----

Given the number of floors of all towers, output the minimum number of charges needed to eliminate all floors of all blocks.

Input
-----

The first line of input contains the number of blocks **n**, where 2 â¤ **n** â¤ 100000. The second line contains **n** consecutive block heights **hi** for **i** = 1, 2, . . . , **n**, where 1 â¤ **hi** â¤ 1000000.

Output
------

Output one line containing one integer: the minimum number of charges needed to tear down all the blocks.
