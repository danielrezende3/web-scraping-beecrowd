# Problem 1233

Descrição
----------

Fernando won a compass for his birthday, and now his favorite hobby is drawing stars: ï¬rst, he marks **N** points on a circumference, dividing it into **N** equal arcs; then, he connects each point to the *k-th* next point, until returning to the ï¬rst point.  

  

Depending on the value of *k*, Fernando may or may not reach all points marked on the circumference; when that happens, the star is called complete. For example, when **N** = 8, the possible stars are shown in the ï¬gure below. Stars (a) and (c) are complete, while stars (b) and (d) are not.

Depending on the value of **N**, it may be possible to draw many diï¬erent stars; Fernando asked you to write a program that, given **N**, determines the number of complete stars he can draw.

Input
-----

The input contains several test cases. Each test case contains a single line, containing a single integer **N** (3 â¤ **N** < 231), indicating the number of arcs in which the circumference was divided.

Output
------

For each test case, your program must print a single line containing a single integer, indicating the number of complete stars that can be drawn.
