# Problem 2238

Descrição
----------

Think a positive number ***n***. Now tell me an **A** divisor of ***n***. Now give me another **B** number than ***n*** divider. Now a multiple **C**. and a non multiple **D**. The number you thought is ...

It looks like a magic trick, but math! Does knowing the numbers **A**, **B**, **C** and **D**, you can discover what the original number ***n***? Note that there may be more than one solution!

This problem, given the values of **A**, **B**, **C** and **D**, you should write a program that determines which the smallest number ***n*** that may have been thought or conclude that there is no possible value.

Input
-----

The input consists of a single row containing four integers **A**, **B**, **C**, and **D**, as described above (1 â¤ **A**, **B**, **C**, **D** â¤ 109).

Output
------

Your program should produce a single line. If there is at least a number ***n*** for which **A**, **B**, **C** and **D** make sense, the line must contain the lowest possible ***n***. Otherwise, the line must contain -1.
