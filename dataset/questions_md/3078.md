# Problem 3078

Descrição
----------

If you went to Goias you've certainly experienced or at least heard about the pequi. The pequi is a typical fruit from the region with some few edible seeds.

In this year ICPC (InstÃ¢ncia Competitiva do Pequi CampeÃ£o) will take place. The ICPC is a competition to determine the best pequi. To make the competition less obvious and more dynamic, the quality of a pequi with **n** seeds will be determined by a non-linear equation.

Define  ââââ***\(\textbf{b} = \textbf{n} \hspace{1mm} MOD \hspace{1mm} 257 \)***,  ***\(\textbf{c} = \textbf{n} \hspace{1mm} MOD \hspace{1mm} 193\)***  and  **\(\textbf{d} = \sqrt[22]{\textbf{b}^{16}}\*\textbf{b}^{3\over11} - \textbf{b} + 4 \)**, the equation that determines the quality of the pequi is given by  \(\textbf{x}^{\textbf{d}} + \textbf{bx}^2 + \textbf{c} = 0 \).

Based on the number of roots of the built equation, a pequi can receive one of the following grades of quality:

* "So o ouro", case the built equation has no real roots.
* "Bom", case the equation has only a real root;
* "Regular", case the equation has more than one real root.

Your task is given the quantity of seeds to discover the degree of quality of a pequi.

Input
-----

The input consist of several test cases. Each test case has a single line with an integer **n** (0 â¤ **n** â¤ 105), the quantity of seeds of the pequi.  

The last test case contains **n** = -1 and must not be processed.

Output
------

For each test case print on a separate line the degree of quality of the pequi without quotation marks ("So o ouro", "Bom" or "Regular").
