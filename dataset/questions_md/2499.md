# Problem 2499

Descrição
----------

Given a triangle ABC with area **S**, and **N** equidistant points on the side AB and **M** equidistant points on the BC side, calculate the triangle's area determined by one of these points in AB with coordinate **C1** and two others over BC with coordinates **C2** and **C3**.

Input
-----

The input is composed by several test cases. The first line of a test case contains three integers **S** (1 â¤ **S** â¤ 106), **N** (0 â¤ **N** â¤ 103) and **M** (0 â¤ **M** â¤ 103) as specified in the text and the second line of a test case contains the coordinates **C1** (0 â¤ **C1** â¤ **N**+1), **C2** (0 â¤ **C2** â¤ **M**+1) and **C3** (0 â¤ **C3** â¤ **M**+1). The input ends when **S**=**N**=**M**=0.

Output
------

The output is composed by one line per test case containing the integer representing the area of the Triangle determined. It is always guaranteed that the area is an integer.
