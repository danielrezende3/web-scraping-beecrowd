# Problem 3154

Descrição
----------

Famous interplanetary traveler, ET Bilu wants to invite people from the planet he is visiting to a Great Party. In Bilu culture, a party can only be considered a Grand Party if at least two participants were born on the same day.

Unlike planet Earth, which has 365 or 366 days each year, the planets Bilu visits have a number of different days.

Even with all the advanced technology of intergalactic travel, Bilu does not know how to calculate the chance that this big event will happen. Therefore, you, who were at a Great Party held on planet Earth, will help Bilu to incorporate a program to estimate the chance of a Great Party on the ship's computer.

Given the number of days per year on the planet Bilu is visiting and the number of people at the party, determine the likelihood that the party will be considered a Great Party.

Input
-----

The entry consists of two integers D and P indicating the number of days and people, respectively.

Limits:

50 <= D <= 10 ^ 5;

2 <= P <= D - 1.

Output
------

The output should be the percentage chance of the event being a Grand Party with two decimal places.
