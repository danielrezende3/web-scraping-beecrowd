# Problem 2514

Descrição
----------

In a galaxy far, far away, there is the planet NlÃ´guÃ©rrÃ , predominantly inhabited by dinosaurs. There are three moons orbiting NlÃ´guÃ©rrÃ . The orbit of each moon has the form of a circumference whose center is NlÃ´guÃ©rrÃ , as indicated by the figure in the left:

When all three moons align between the planet and the sun, as indicated by the figure in the right, a horrible catastrophe happens! The last time it occurred, exactly **M** years ago, a big drought doomed the entire planet, reducing the number of dinosaurs by half. The first moon takes **L1** years to complete an orbit around the planet; the second moon takes **L2** years to complete an orbit around the planet; and the third moon takes **L3** years to do so. Determine how many years will pass until the next alignment.

Consider that both the planet and the sun are stacionary.

Input
-----

The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains the integer **M** (1 â¤ **M** â¤ 109), indicating that the last alignment occurred **M** years ago. The second line contains three integers **L1**, **L2** and **L3** (1 â¤ **L1**, **L2**, **L3** â¤ 103), the time it takes, in years, for each moon to complete its orbit around the planet. It is guaranteed that no alignment occurred in the last **M**-1 years, and no alignment occurs this year.

The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).

Output
------

For each test case, print a line containing a number **X** indicating that the next alignment between the planet and the sun will occur in **X** years from this day.
