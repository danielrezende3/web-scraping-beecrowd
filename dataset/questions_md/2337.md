# Problem 2337

Descrição
----------

Francisco is a big fan of the game "Letâs flip a coin" and loves to play it with your lucky coin, but Francisco has some playing conditions. He always chooses "Head" and in each round of the game can be multiple currency pitches. Another thing is that Francis hates when the currency falls with the "Tail" face in two consecutive pitches. Curious, Francisco wanted to know what is the probability that in a game of "Letâs flip a coin" will not occur "Tail" in two consecutive shots, however, as he only likes to play, he asked you to do a program that calculates it to him.

Input
-----

The input contains several test cases, each line of input will contain an integer **N** (0<**N**â¤40) representing the amount of pitches in a single match.

Output
------

For each input line should be only one output line. The output should contain the probability of no consecutive "Tails". The answer must be in the form of irreducible fraction.

Thanks Wesley Rocha and William Azevedo the name of the question.
