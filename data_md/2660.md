# Problem 2660

Descrição
----------

American "periodical cicadas" have the longest life cycle of any known insect. Every 17 years, these periodical cicadas mature, mate, lay eggs, and die. Their young take refuge underground, 20 centimeters deep, where they will feed on root sap for 17 years, until their day comes to seek a place in the sun.

It is believed that this number did not happen by chance; other cicada species in the region have 13-year cycles, so these two species emerge at the same time only every 221 years. This is desirable because in this way the chance of the two species mixing considerably decreases, and undesirable characteristics from one population are not introduced into the other.

Inspired by this phenomenon, a new variation of the evolutionary algorithm was created. In the last step of this algorithm the best possible solutions are divided into populations so that each population **i** has a life cycle **Ci** . In addition an extra population is also added, so that the number of iterations until the life cycles of all populations match is as large as possible. These populations are then evaluated until they all have the same life cycle, and the best solution at the end of the process is chosen. Since it is not interesting to wait too long for the algorithm to generate an answer, an upper limit **L** on the number of iterations must also be respected.

Given the life cycles of the populations created and the limit on the number of iterations **L**, your task is to compute the optimal period for the extra population that will be added

Input
-----

The first input line contains two integers **N** and **L**, respectively, the amount of populations generated by the previous steps of the algorithm and the limit on the amount of iterations, 2 â¤ **N** â¤ 104 , 1 â¤ **L** â¤ 106.The next line contains the **N** values **Ci** representing the amount of iterations in the life cycle of each population, where 1 â¤ **Ci** . You can assume that the life cycles of the current populations coincide in less than **L** iterations.

Output
------

Your program needs to produce a single line with an integer representing the period of the extra population that maximizes the amount **T** of iterations until the life cycles of all populations coincide, respecting the constraint that **T** â¤ **L**. If there is more than one possible value print the smallest of them.
