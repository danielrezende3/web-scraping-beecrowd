# Problem 3339

Descrição
----------

Professor Karina usually teaches Discrete Mathematics classes for the Computer Science course. During online classes, she suspected that her students weren't paying attention and decided to take an exam/competition on kahoot.

As the class of the day was about **perfect squares**, in each test/competition question she would give an interval [**L**, **R**] (**limits included**) and would like to know how many **perfect squares** exist within the given interval.

Just to remind you, a **perfect square** is an integer square root number. Ex: *0*, *1*, *4* and *9*.

Input
-----

In the first line, an integer **Q** is passed representing the number of questions in the test/competition. In the next **Q** rows there will be two integers **L**, **R** in each row representing the limits.

The restrictions for the values are as follows:

* \(1 \leq \textbf{Q} \leq 10^3\)
* \(0 \leq \textbf{L} \leq \textbf{R} \leq 10^{8}\)

Output
------

For each question it is necessary to print an integer representing the number of **perfect squares** within the range [**L**, **R**] (**limits included**).
