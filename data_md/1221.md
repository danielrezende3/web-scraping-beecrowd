# Problem 1221

Descrição
----------

Mary knows that a Prime Number is a number that is divisible only by 1 (one) and by itself. For example the number 7 is Prime, because it can be divided only by 1 and by 7. So she asked you to write a program that reads many numbers ââand inform if each one of these numbers are prime or not. But Patience is not one of the virtues of Mariazinha, so she wants that the execution of all test cases (instances) created by herself happen at the maximum in one second, because she hates waiting :>).
