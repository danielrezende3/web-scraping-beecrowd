# Problem 1745

Descrição
----------

Substrings are strings formed by choosing a subset of contiguous characters from a string. This is well known. A little more obscure is the definition of substhreengs. A substhreeng is a substring which complies to the following additional requirements:

1. It is non-empty, and composed entirely of base 10 digits.

2. Interpreted in base 10 (allowing extra leading zeros), the resulting integer is a multiple of 3.

For instance, the string â130a303â contains 9 substhreengs: the substhreeng â3â three times, the substhreengs â30â and â0â twice each, and the substhreengs â303â and â03â once each. The substring â30a3â is not a substhreeng because it is not composed entirely of base 10 digits, while the substring â13â is not a substhreeng because 13 is not a multiple of 3.

Notice that two substhreengs are considered different if they are different in length or start at a different position, even if the selected characters are the same.

Given a string, you are asked to count the number of substhreengs it contains.

Input
-----

The input consists of a single line that contains a non-empty string **S** of at most 10 6 characters. Each character of **S** is either a digit or a lowercase letter.

Output
------

Output a line with an integer representing the number of substhreengs contained in **S**.
