Descrição
----------

A designer invented a brand for a company in tetrahedron form. He has several colors available to paint and want to know how many different ways a tetrahedron can be colored using any combination of  colors  on  the  faces  of  the same. Note that, if by convenient rotations, the coloring of two tetrahedra match, then it is the same coloration.

Help this designer do this calculation.
