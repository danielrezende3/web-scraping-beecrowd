# Problem 1138

Descrição
----------

Diana is going to write a list of all positive integers between **A** and **B**, inclusive, in base 10 and without any leading zeros. She wants to know how many times each digit is going to be used.

Input
-----

Each test case is given in a single line that contains two integers **A** and **B** (1 â¤ **A**â¤ **B**â¤ 108). The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.

Output
------

For each test case print a single line with 10 integers representing the number of times each digit is used when writing all integers between **A** and **B**, inclusive, in base 10 and without leading zeros. Write the counter for each digit in increasing order from 0 to 9.
