# Problem 1230

Descrição
----------

Given a positive integer *n*, denote by [*n*] the real interval {*x* : 0 â¤ *x* â¤ *n*}. A function *f* : [*n*] â R. Values of *f* are provided on a subset *S* of [*n*], thereby partially specifying *f*.

The set *S* satisï¬es the following properties:

1. The points in S are all integers.

2. The extremes 0 and *n* of [*n*] are both in *S*.

The function *f* satisï¬es the following properties:

1. The values of *f* in the integral points of [n] are integers.

2. For every integral point *x* in [*n*] \ *S* (ie, the integral points of [n] are not in S), the function f is monotonic in the interval [x â 1, x + 1]. In other words, at least one of the inequalities *f*(*x* â 1) â¤ *f*(*x*) â¤ *f*(*x* + 1) and *f*(*x* â 1) â¥ *f*(*x*) â¥ *f*(*x* + 1) is satisï¬ed.

3. For each non-integral point *x* in [*n*], the value of *f*(*x*) is given by the linear interpolation of *f*(â*x*â) and f(â*x*â), ie, *f*(*x*) = (*x* â â*x*â)*f*(â*x*â) + (â*x*â â *x*)*f*(â*x*â).

We still have the freedom of specifying the values of f in the integral points of [*n*] \ *S* (note however that *S* can contain all the integral points of [*n*]). We would like to use this ï¬exibility to make ![](https://resources.beecrowd.com/gallery/images/problems/UOJ_1230.png)*f*(*x*)dx = *y*, i.e., the area under *f*(x) between the extremes 0 and *n* equal to *y*, a given value. Your problem then is to decide whether this is possible or not.

Input
-----

The input contains several test cases. The ï¬rst line of a test case contains three integers, **N** (1 â¤ **N** â¤ 106), **M** and **Y** (0 â¤ **Y** â¤ 109), respectively the amplitude of the interval, the size of *S* and the value of **y**. Each of the following **M** lines describes function *f* at a point of *S*, containing two integers **X** (0 â¤ **X** â¤ **N**, â**X** â **S**) and **F** (0 â¤ **F** â¤ 106), representing *f**(X)* = **F**. The values of **X** are not necessarily in ascending order.

Note.:  ![](https://resources.beecrowd.com/gallery/images/problems/UOJ_1230.png) *f(x)dx* â¤ 109 for any assignment of values to *f*(*x*) para *x* â [*n*] \ **S** satisfying the stated constraints.

Output
------

For each test case, determine whether there is a value assignment to *f**(x)* for each integral point x â [n] \ *S* such that ![](https://resources.beecrowd.com/gallery/images/problems/UOJ_1230.png)*f*(*x*)*dx* = *y*, i.e. the area under *f**(x)* between the ends 0 and *n* is equal to *y*. If not, your program should print a line containing only the character âNâ. If the assignments are possible, your program should print a line containing the character âSâ, followed by values of *f**(x)* for the integral points *x* in [n] \ *S*, in increasing order of the values of x. The initial character and following values, if any, should be separated by a blank space. If more than one solution is possible, then print the lexicographically smallest solution.
