# Problem 2661

Descrição
----------

All positive integers can be written as a product of powers of primes. For example, 252 = 22 \* 32 \* 7. An integer is stripped if it can be written as a product of two or more distinct primes, without repetition. For example, 6 = 2 \* 3 and 14 = 2 \* 7 are stripped, but 28 = 22 \* 7, 1, 17 are not stripped.

Input
-----

The input consists of a single line that contains an integer **N**(1 â¤ **N** â¤ 1012).

Output
------

Your program is required to produce a single line with an integer representing the number of divisors stripped of **N**.
