# Problem 2001

Descrição
----------

Bile is a smart kid who likes quite recurrences. He was participating in a competition in which the best sequence wins a prize. Bile created a sequence *F*, in the sequence, the first *N* values are known, and to discover the value of *F**k* for a *K* *N* is used to formulate below.

For *N* *K*: *F**K* = 1\**F**K*-1 + 2\**F**K*-2 + ... + *N*\**F**K-N*

But he does not know calculate quickly the values of their sequence and asked for your help.

  

In the first test case: *N* = 2, *K* = 3, *F*1 = 2, *F*2 = 5, *F*3 = *F*2 + 2\**F*1 = 9, *F*4 = *F*3 + 2\**F*2 = 19 ...

Input
-----

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers, **N** ( 2 â¤ **N** â¤ 100 ) and **K** ( **N** â¤ **K** â¤ 1018 ), representing the number of values of the first known sequence Bile. The second line consists of **N** integers **F**i ( **F**1, **F**2, â¦ ,**F****N** ) and ( 0 â¤ **F****i** â¤ 1010 ) representing the values initially known. The entry ends with the final file (EOF).

Output
------

For each test case you should to print the value **F****K** and the sum of all elements of bile function minor or equal to **F****K**, separated by a single space. Your answers should be submitted in module 303700049.
