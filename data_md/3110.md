# Problem 3110

Descrição
----------

Xorshift random number generators are a class of pseudorandom number generators that were discovered by George Marsaglia. They have a particularly efficient implementation without using excessively sparse polynomials. They generate the next number in their sequence by repeatedly taking the exclusive or of a number with a bit-shifted version of itself. This makes them extremely fast on modern computer architectures.

In an attempt to create its own encryption, Farcos converts a message into an array of 64-bit integers and applies exclusive or to each element **Ei** with **Ki**-th element of an Xorshift sequence that uses **S** as the seed. In other words, a **E** array was created such that:

An this:

The code snippets shown are implemented in c++.

Provided arrays **E**, **K**, and seed **S**, your task is to decipher the original array **D**.

Input
-----

The first line of input contains five integers: **N** (0 < **N** â¤ 102), the number of elements in the arrays; **S** (0 < **S** < 264), the seed to Xorshift; **A**, **B** and **C** (0 < **A**, **B**, **C** < 64), the Xorshift parameters shown in the code.

The second line of input has **N** integers **Ei** (0 < **Ei** < 264) separated by a blank space.

The third line of input has **N** integers **Ki** (0 < **Ki** < 264) separated by a blank space.

Output
------

The output consists of a single line containing **N** integers **Di** separated by a blank space and representing the deciphered array.
