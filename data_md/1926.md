# Problem 1926

Descrição
----------

Marianne is programming her own game called âHero of the Guitarâ . Itâs a extremely tiresome work, that needs a lot of time and effort, but nothing that some free time doesn't solves. Someday she received an e-mail, in the e-mail Mari has encountered a very curious problem proposed by the cousins RenÃ¨ and Leonhard and the twins Isaac and Carl.

The problem is described as the following:

âA natural number is prime, if itâs divided by exactly two numbers: number one and it self (one isn't prime). A number is twin prime, if and only if, itâs prime and there is another prime number b, such that |a - b| = 2. An example: number 3 is twin prime, because itâs prime and thereâs another prime (5) with |3 - 5| = 2. But number 23, despite being a prime number, isn't twin prime. Could you tell me how much twin primes there is between two numbers *x* and *y*?â

Marianne loves to solve this kind of problem, but she is busy programming her game. Could you help her?

Input
-----

In the first line there is an integer 1 â¤ **Q** â¤ 105, the number of querys, each of the next **Q** lines will have two numbers, 1 â¤ **X**, **Y** â¤ 106.

Output
------

For each query **Q**, print the quantity of twin primes between **X** and **Y**, inclusive.
