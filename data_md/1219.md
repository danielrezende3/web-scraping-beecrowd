Millionaire Mr Smith is well-known -- not for his wealth, but for his odd sense of "art"... Mr Smith has got a circular garden. On the boundary he picks three points and gets a triangle. He then finds the largest circle in that triangular region. So he gets something like this (Please click here for a black-and-white version of the figure):

Mr Smith then plants yellow sunflowers, blue violets and red roses in the way shown in the figure. (Nice combination, eh? :-) Given the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, you are to find the areas of the regions with each kind of flowers respectively.

Input
-----

Each line of input contains three integers **a**, **b**, **c**, the lengths of the three sides of the triangular region, with 0 < **a** â¤ **b** â¤ **c** â¤ 1000. The input is terminated by end of file (EOF).

Output
------

For each case, your program should output the areas of the regions with sunflowers, with violets and with roses respectively. Print your answers correct to 4 decimal places.
