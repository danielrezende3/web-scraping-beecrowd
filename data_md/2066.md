# Problem 2066

Descrição
----------

A *reverse number* of a natural number **N** is the number which we obtain when we read the digits of **N** from the right to the left. For example, the reverse number of 1234 is 4321 and the reverse number of 150 (a number with 3 digits) is 51 (a number with 2 digits). In this problem, we say that a number is *well-reversible* if it is strictly less than its reverse number. Examples of well-reversible numbers are 1234, 15 and 819.

Input
-----

The single line of the input consists of a single positive integer **K** (**K** â¤ 18).

Output
------

The single line of the output shall consist singly of the number of numbers with exact **K** digits which are well-reversible.
