# Problem 1197

Descrição
----------

A particle has initial velocity and constant acceleration. If its velocity after certain time is v then what will its displacement be in twice of that time?

Input
-----

The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of input. These two integers denote the value of **v** (-100 â¤ **v** â¤ 100) and t(0 â¤ **t** â¤ 200) ( **t** means at the time the particle gains that velocity). The end of the input is determined by EOF.

Output
------

For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the displacement in double of that time.
