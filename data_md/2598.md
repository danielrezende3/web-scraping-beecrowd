# Problem 2598

Descrição
----------

TaxilÃ¢ndia's government is facing a huge problem, the people of TaxilÃ¢ndia love cars and speed, so they are running a lot in the avenues of the city. To mitigate this problem the government will install radars on the avenues, so that each section is covered by at least one radar. It is important to know that a radar covers miles along the avenue.

You were hired by the government to make a program that given the length of the avenue and the radar coverage area, inform the minimum amount of radars needed to cover the avenue.

The image below shows an avenue of size 15 kilometers and radars with a coverage of 4 kilometers, each color represents a radar, so it is possible to notice that the minimum number of radars needed to cover the avenue is 4.
