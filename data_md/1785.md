# Problem 1785

Descrição
----------

The number 6174 is known as Krapekarâs constant after the Indian mathematician Dattathreya Ramachandra Kaprekar. This number is interesting because of the following fact: let X be any 4-digit number (leading 0âs are allowed) in which not all of them are the same, then Krapekarâs routine starting at this number always converge to 6174. That is, Krapekarâs routine converges to 6174 if, and only if, X is a 4-digit number and at least two of them are pairwise different. Krapekarâs routine is defined as follows:

  

int krapekar(int X) {

   int cnt = 0;

   while (X != 6174) {

       int hi = highest\_number\_with\_digits\_of(X);

       int lo = lowest\_number\_with\_digits\_of(X);

       X = hi - lo;

       cnt = cnt + 1;

   }

   return cnt;

}

  

highest\_number\_with\_digits\_of(X) is the highest number that can be made using Xâs digits.

lowest\_number\_with\_digits\_of(X) is the lowest number that can be made using Xâs digits.

  

For example:

highest\_number\_with\_digits\_of(3524) = 5432

lowest\_number\_with\_digits\_of(3524) = 2345

highest\_number\_with\_digits\_of(10) = 1000 //because 10 = 0010 with four digits.

lowest\_number\_with\_digits\_of(10) = 1

Input
-----

The first line contains an integer **T** (1 â¤ **T** â¤ 10â´), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing an integer **X** (0 â¤ **X** â¤ 9999).

Output
------

For each test case print âCaso #**X**: **Y**â, where **X** is the number of the current case, starting at 1, and **Y** is the return of Krapekarâs routine or -1 in case it stays in an infinite loop.
