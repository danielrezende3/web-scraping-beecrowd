# Problem 2154

Descrição
----------

The calculation of a derivative of a function in the form xn is defined by:

f(x) = xn    â     f(x)â = n.xn-1

Here's an example:

f(x) = 4x3 + 3x2    â     f(x)â = 12x2 + 6x

Write a program that, given a simple polynomial, calculate its derivative.

Input
-----

There will be several test cases. Each test case is formed by an integer **T**, which is the number of terms that has the polynomial. In the next line, there is the polynomial itself, formed by **T** ( 1 â¤ **T** â¤ 100) terms, each separated by a space, a sum signal and another space, and each containing an integer **C** ( 2 â¤ **C** â¤ 100), the letter ***x*** and an integer **E** ( 2 â¤ **E** â¤ 100 ), and the coefficient **C** and **E** the exponent of the term. The entry ends with end of file.

Output
------

For each test case, print the polynomial with the derivative applied.
