# Problem 2505

Descrição
----------

Some numbers in mathematics, due to their uniquiness, are given a special name. Particularly, there is a set of numbers, we will call "*Autopotential*". A number **N** is called Autopotential when *NN* gives a result where the last digits is, exactly, **N**. For example:

1: 11= 1 -> It is autopotential.  

3: 33= 27 -> it is not autopotential.  

10: 1010= 10,000,000,000 -> It is not autopotential.  

11: 1111 = 285,311,670,611 -> It is autopotential.

Input
-----

The input is defined as several test cases. Each line represents a test case and contains a unique integer value **N**, where 0 < **N** < 1,000,000.

Output
------

For each test case from input, your program must generate on output one unique line that contains a single word: "SIM", if the value from input is an Autopotential numer, or "NAO" otherwise.


| Input Sample | Output Sample |
| --- | --- |
| 1 3 6 10 11 | SIM NAO SIM NAO SIM |
