Write a program that, given the length of one side of a regular pentagon, computes your area.

Input
-----

There will be a value **C** that indicates the number of test cases. Then there will be an integer **N** for each case (1 â¤ **N** â¤ 10000), indicating the length of the side of a regular pentagon.

Output
------

For each test case, print the corresponding value of the area of ââthe respective pentagon, with three decimal digits of precision.
