# Problem 1429

Descrição
----------

Mathew, an engineering freshman, is developing an original positional notation for representing integer numbers. He called it âA Curious Methodâ (ACM for short). The ACM notation uses the same digits as the decimal notation, i.e., 0 through 9.

To convert a number A from ACM to decimal notation you must add *k* terms, where *k* is the number of digits of *A* (in the ACM notation). The value of the *i*-th term, corresponding the *i*-th digit *ai*, counting from right to left, is *ai* Ã *i*!. For instance 719*ACM* is equivalent to 5310, since 7 Ã 3! + 1 Ã 2! + 9 Ã 1! = 53.

Mathew has just begun studying number theory, and probably does not know which properties a numbering system should have, but at the moment he is only interested in converting a number from ACM to decimal. Could you help him?

Input
-----

Each test case is given in a single line that contains a non-empty string of at most 5 digits, representing a number in ACM notation. The string does not have leading zeros.

The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.

Output
------

For each test case output a single line containing the decimal representation of the corresponding ACM number.
