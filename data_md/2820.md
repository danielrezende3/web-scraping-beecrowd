# Problem 2820

Descrição
----------

Bruna is learning to count. She already knows d digits. Her brother, Carlos, told her that she can't even form n distinct numbers using those digits only. Bruna, to prove that he is wrong, will write the n smallest numbers that she can make using only the digits she knows in a sheet of paper, but she doesn't know when to stop. Can you help her wit that task?

Input
-----

The first line of input consists of a number **t**(**t**=100) , the number of test cases.

Each case starts with an integer**d** (2<=**d**<=9): the number of digits Bruna has already learned.

The following line will contain d integers **v****i** (1<=**v****i**<=9): the digits Bruna knows.

The last line of each case will be the number **n**(1<=**n**<=1018).

Output
------

For each case, print the nth smallest number that can be made using the digits Bruna knows.
