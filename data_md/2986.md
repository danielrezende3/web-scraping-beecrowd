# Problem 2986

Descrição
----------

Once, while studying for the Porgramption Marathon, Tobias and I come across an interesting problem, I hope you enjoy it too.

There is a staircase with **N** steps. You can choose to go down 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time with each move. How many different ways could you go down this stair with **N** steps?

Input
-----

A single integer **N** (1 â¤ **N** â¤ 1,000,000), the number of stairs in the ladder.

Output
------

A single integer, the number combinations of different ways down the ladder. The answer may be a little big, so print the rest of the division by our favorite cousin (109 + 7).
